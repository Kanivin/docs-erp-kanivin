<p><strong>A Supplier Quotation is document by a potential supplier specifying the cost of goods or services they'll provide within a specified period.</strong></p>
<p>A Supplier Quotation may also contain terms of sale, terms of payment, and warranties. Acceptance of quotation by the buyer can be considered as an agreement binding on both parties.</p>

<h3 id="21-supplier-quotation-from-material-request">2.1 Supplier Quotation from Material Request</h3>
<p>You can make a supplier quotation from a Material Request:
<img alt="Supplier Quotation from Material Receipt" class="screenshot" src="/files/supplier-quotation-from-mr.png"/></p>
<p>Or:</p>
<p>A Supplier Quotation can be created from a <a href="/kanvinerp/v13/user/manual/en/buying/supplier">Supplier master</a>.</p>
<p>Or:</p>
<p>The supplier can submit you a quotation himself via KanivinERP. To know more about this, see section visit the <a href="/kanvinerp/v13/user/manual/en/buying/request-for-quotation#4-creating-a-supplier-quotation-after-rfq">Request for Quotation page</a>.</p>
<h3 id="22-creating-a-supplier-quotation-manually">2.2 Creating a Supplier Quotation manually</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>You can also make a Supplier Quotation directly from:</p>
<p><strong>Buying &gt; Purchasing &gt; Supplier Quotation &gt; New</strong>.</p></li>
<li>Select the Supplier who sent you the quotation.</li>
<li>The Address and Contact will be fetched if you've saved it in the supplier master.</li>
<li>Enter the Item code, select the quantity. Rate will be fetched if you've set the Standard Buying rate for the item in <a onclick="loadContent('item-price.html')">Item Price</a>.
<img alt="Supplier Quotation" class="screenshot" src="/files/supplier-quotation.png"/></li>
</ol>
<p>If you have multiple Suppliers who supply you with the same Item, you
usually send out a <a href="/kanvinerp/v13/user/manual/en/buying/request-for-quotation">Request for Quotation</a> to various Suppliers. In
many cases, especially if you have centralized buying, you may want to record all the quotes so that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can easily compare prices in the future</li>
<li>Audit whether all Suppliers were given the opportunity to quote.</li>
</ul>
<p>Supplier Quotations are not necessary for most small businesses. Always
evaluate the cost of collecting information to the value it really provides!
As a recommendation, you can do this only for high value items.</p>
