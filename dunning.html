<h2 id="2-how-to-create-a-dunning">2. How to create a Dunning</h2>
<p>A Dunning is created against a list of overdue scheduled payments. You can create a dunning in two different ways:</p>
<h3 id="a-create-a-new-dunning">a) Create a new Dunning</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go to the <strong>Dunning</strong> list and click on "Add Dunning".</li>
<li>Select a <strong>Customer</strong> and click "Fetch Overdue Payments". This will show a list of overdue Sales Invoices for this customer. Select the ones you would like to fetch into this <strong>Dunning</strong> and click on "Get Items".</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="b-create-a-dunning-from-an-overdue-sales-invoice">b) Create a Dunning from an overdue Sales Invoice</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go to the <strong>Sales Invoice</strong> list and open any overdue <strong>Sales Invoice</strong>.</li>
<li>Click on "Create &gt; Dunning". This will fetch all overdue payments from the invoice's payment schedule table into a new <strong>Dunning</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="fill-the-remaining-fields">Fill the remaining fields</h3>
<ol>
<li>Select a <strong>Dunning Type</strong> to fill interest, dunning fees and text blocks with predetermined values. Or you can set these values manually as well.</li>
<li>You can already set an income <strong>Account</strong> (for example, "Other interest and similar income") and <strong>Cost Center</strong> for the income generated from interest and dunning fees. These will be used once a <strong>Payment Entry</strong> is created from this <strong>Dunning</strong>.</li>
<li><p>Save and submit the <strong>Dunning</strong> before sending it to the <strong>Customer</strong>.</p>

</ol>
<h3 id="21-what-is-a-dunning-type">2.1 What is a Dunning Type</h3>
<p>Dunning Type stores default values for dunning fee, interest rate and text blocks to be included. For example, a Dunning Type "First Notice" will not have any fees, but Dunning Type "Second Notice" will have a dunning fee and interest charged on the outstanding amount.</p>
<p><img alt="Dunning Type" class="screenshot" src="/files/first_dunning.png"/></p>
<h3 id="22-statuses">2.2 Statuses</h3>
<p>These are the statuses that are auto-assigned to Dunning.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Draft</strong>: A draft is saved but yet to be submitted.</li>
<li><strong>Unresolved</strong>: The Dunning is unresolved when it is submitted but no payments have been received.</li>
<li><strong>Resolved</strong>: The Dunning is resolved when the outstanding payment has been received.</li>
<li><strong>Cancelled</strong>: A cancelled status is a cancelled Dunning document.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-payment">3. Payment</h2>
<p>When you receive a full payment, including interest and fees, please open the unresolved <strong>Dunning</strong> and click on "Create &gt; Payment". This will create a <strong>Payment Entry</strong> against the outstanding scheduled payments and record the interest and fees as "Payment Deductions or Loss". The <strong>Payment Entry</strong> will automatically set the <strong>Dunning</strong>'s status to resolved.</p>
