<h3 id="21-link-an-address-to-multiple-entities">2.1 Link an Address to Multiple Entities</h3>

<p><img alt="Link One Address to Multiple Entities" class="screenshot" src="/files/link-address-to-multiple-entities.png"/></p>
<h3 id="22-address-title">2.2 Address Title</h3>

<p><img alt="Address Title" class="screenshot" src="/files/address-title.png"/></p>
<h3 id="23-preferred-billing-address-and-shipping-address">2.3 Preferred Billing Address and Shipping Address</h3>
<p>If you check 'Preferred Shipping Address', the address would be automatically added in the Shipping Address in Sales Order, Sales Invoice and Delivery Note transactions.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you check 'Preferred Billing Address', the address would be automatically added in the Billing Address in Sales Order, Sales Invoice and Delivery Note transactions.</p>
<h3 id="24-gst-localization-for-india">2.4 GST Localization for India</h3>
<p>If the customer or supplier has registered under GST, you can enter GSTIN and GST State in Address. Make sure GSTIN entered is in valid format.
<img alt="GST Details in Address" class="screenshot" src="/files/gst-details-in-address.png"/></p>
<p>In sales transactions along with address, GSTIN is also fetched.</p>
<p><img alt="GST Details in Sales Order" class="screenshot" src="/files/gst-details-in-sales-order.png"/></p>
<p>You can also add addresses of your own company's facilities. Check 'Is Your Company Address', select Company in Link DocType, and Company Name in Link Name for such addresses and you can select them in GST Sales Invoice to print your own address.</p>
<p><img alt="Company Address" class="screenshot" src="/files/company-address.png"/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>GSTIN is to be added in Address and not in Customer/Supplier, as one Customer/Supplier may have multiple GSTIN (one for each state where he conducts his business).</p>
