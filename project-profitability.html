<div class="wiki-content">
<p>Project and related activities are generally active for longer periods. While developments keep happening on the Project, various transactions are done against each project. While new developments keep happening on a project, it may lead to more investment in terms of time, money, and material. Hence, it becomes important to track the Profitability of a Project to ensure that you don't overspend.</p>
<p>In simple terms, Project Profitability is the difference between the revenue generated from a project versus the costs associated with it.</p>
