<p><strong>A Promotional Scheme is a temporary discount on one or more products.</strong></p>
<p>Promotional schemes help businesses become successful as lower prices for a limited period of time to attract more Customers. They can be easily configured in KanivinERP. A Promotional scheme is linked to a pricing rule, against each slab system that will generate the pricing rule.</p>
<p>On creating a Promotional Scheme, the system creates a <a href="/kanvinerp/v13/user/manual/en/accounts/pricing-rule">Pricing Rule</a>. A Promotional Scheme can have multiple Pricing Rules associated with it. In KanivinERP, a Promotional Scheme is an easier way to manage pricing on multiple Item/Groups based on different parties and conditions.</p>
<p>To access the Promotional Scheme list, go to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Home &gt; Selling &gt; Items and Pricing &gt; Promotional Scheme</p>

<li><a onclick="loadContent('item.html')">Item</a></li>
<li><a onclick="loadContent('item-group.html')">Item Group</a></li>
<li><a onclick="loadContent('customer.html')">Customer</a></li>
<li><a onclick="loadContent('supplier.html')">Supplier</a></li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Go to the Promotional Scheme list and click on New.</li>
<li>Enter a title for the rule.</li>
<li>Select what to Apply On like Item Code, Item Group, Brand, or Transaction. Selecting Transaction will apply the scheme on the total amount of the transaction.</li>

<h3 id="21-additional-fields-when-creating-a-promotional-scheme">2.1 Additional fields when creating a Promotional Scheme</h3>
<h4 id="mixed-conditions">Mixed Conditions</h4>
<p>If you select two or more Items and set the Min and Max Quantity. The Promotional Scheme will be applied only if the total sum of Items matches the set quantities. For example, you create a Promotional Scheme on Item 1 and Item 2 and set the Min and Max Quantity as 30, the Promotional Scheme will apply only if the total quantity is 30.</p>
<h4 id="is-cumulative">Is Cumulative</h4>
<p>Enabling this options allows the Promotional Scheme to be applied cumulatively. You need to set the 'Min Amt' and 'Max Amt' for this.</p>
<p>Consider a scenario where the Min Amt is 1,500 and Max Amt is 2,000. Now, if one transaction is created for 1,400 then the Promotional Scheme will not be applied. However, on creating a second invoice of amount 600, Promotional Scheme will be applied. This happened since the total (cumulative) amount of the invoices added up to 2,000. Note that the discount will be applied only to the latest transaction that crosses the cumulative limit.</p>
<p>This can be useful to give discounts if a Customer buys an Item multiple times and you want to reward him with discounts/special prices.</p>
<h2 id="3-features">3. Features</h2>
<h3 id="31-apply-scheme-on-other-item">3.1 Apply Scheme On Other Item</h3>
<p>This feature checks condition on the first Item but applies scheme/discount/rate on another Item.</p>
<p>For example, set Item1 and Item2 in the 'Apply Rule On' table and set 'Apply Rule On Other' on Item3. Now, if the transaction has Item1, Item2, and Item3, the Pricing Rule will apply on Item3 since the first two Items were present in the transaction.</p>
<h3 id="32-party-information">3.2 Party Information</h3>
<p>Set whether the Promotional Scheme is for Selling of Buying the Item.</p>
<p>Based on your selection you can set applicability to one of the following masters.</p>
<ul>
<li><a onclick="loadContent('customer.html')">Customer</a></li>
<li><a onclick="loadContent('customer-group.html')">Customer Group</a></li>
<li><a onclick="loadContent('territory.html')">Territory</a></li>
<li><a onclick="loadContent('sales-partner.html')">Sales Partner</a></li>

<li><a onclick="loadContent('supplier.html')">Supplier</a></li>
<li>Supplier Group</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="setting-the-discountrate">Setting the Discount/Rate</h3>

<li><strong>Discount Percentage</strong>: A specific discount percentage can be set. For example, a 10% discount on an Item worth 500 would result in a price of 450.</li>
<li><strong>Discount Amount</strong>: A fixed discount amount will be applied. For example if you sell an Item for 100 and want to sell it with a discount of 7, then this condition can be set using the Discount Amount option.</li>

<li><p><strong>Threshold for Suggestion</strong>: This is the threshold based on which the system will notify you to adjust Item Quantity for discount. For example, if the Min Quantity is 10 and the Threshold is 9, the system will notify to add 1 more Item for the discount to be applicable. This also applies to the amount set.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Validate Applied Rule</strong>: If the entered price is not valid for the Item, the system will not allow you to apply a different rate/discount.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="35-product-discount-slabs">3.5 Product Discount Slabs</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Apply Multiple Pricing Rules</strong>: To understand this, consider an Item of Rate 500. There are two Pricing Rules on it P1 and P2. P1 applies 10% discount and P2 applies 5%. Enabling this option will apply a total of 15% on the Item Rate which gives 425.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>UoM</strong>: The Promotional Scheme will apply only if the UoM set here matches with the transaction.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rate</strong>: An Item may be offered free of cost by the Supplier but there may be some tax applicable. Entering a Rate here means that the Customer will have to pay the applicable taxes.</p></li>
