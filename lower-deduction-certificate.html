<h1 class="wiki-title">Lower Deduction Certificate
</h1>
</div>
<div class="wiki-content">
<p>According to the tax withholding category, a person responsible for making payments is required to deduct tax at source at prescribed rates. Instead of receiving tax on your income from you at a later date, the government wants the payers to deduct tax beforehand and deposit it with the government. However this scheme of deducting tax at source may cause issues to a few taxpayers who may not have taxable income for that fiscal year.</p>
<p>Therefore, for such taxpayers, the government provides an option to obtain a certificate confirming to either a lower rate or NIL rate of TDS compared to the rate specified in the tax withholding category.</p>

<p><img alt="Tax Withholding Category" class="screenshot" src="/files/tax-withholding-category.png"/></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Set the Tax Withholding Category for the Supplier in the supplier master. Then upon selecting that Supplier, a checkbox will become visible in the Purchase Invoice to select whether to apply tax or not and the TDS category will be auto-fetched.</p>

<li><p>Let's create an invoice for 20,000. Saving the invoice automatically calculates tax and appends it in the Purchase Taxes and Charges table. Although the tax category assigned to the supplier has a tax rate of 5%, the prevailing tax rate is 1% which is mentioned in the Lower Deduction Certificate.</p>
