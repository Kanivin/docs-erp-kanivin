<h3 id="37-taxes-and-charges">3.7 Taxes and Charges</h3>
<p>If your Supplier is going to charge you additional taxes or charge like a shipping or insurance charge, you can add it here. It will help you to accurately track your costs. Also, if some of these charges add to the value of the product you will have to mention them in the Taxes table.</p>
<p>Visit the <a href="/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/buying/purchase-taxes-and-charges-template">Purchase Taxes and Charges Template</a> page to know more about taxes.</p>

<p><img alt="Purchase Order Taxes" class="screenshot" src="/files/po-taxes.png"/> </p>
<p>For example, you buy Items worth X and sell them for 1.3X. So, your Customer pays 1.3 times the tax you pay your Supplier. Since you have already paid tax to your Supplier for X, what you owe your government is only the tax on 0.3X.</p>
<p>This is very easy to track in KanivinERP since each tax head is also an Account. Ideally you must create two Accounts for each type of VAT you pay and collect, “Purchase VAT-X” (asset) and “Sales VAT-X” (liability), or something to that effect.</p>
<h3 id="38-additional-discount">3.8 Additional Discount</h3>
