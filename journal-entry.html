<p><strong>A Journal Entry is an entry made in the general ledger and it indicates the affected accounts.</strong></p>
<p>A Journal Entry is a multi purpose transaction where the debit and credit accounts can be selected.</p>
<p>All types of accounting entries other than Sales and Purchase transactions are made using the <strong>Journal Entry</strong>. A <strong>Journal Entry</strong> is a standard accounting transaction that affects multiple Accounts and the sum of debits is equal to the sum of credits. A Journal Entry Impacts the main ledger.</p>
<p>Journal Entries can be used for entering expenses, opening entries, contra entries, bank payments, excise entries, etc. For example, booking running expenses, direct expenses like petrol/transport, sundry expenses, adjustment entries, and adjusting invoice amount.</p>

<p>Note: From version-13 onwards we have introduced immutable ledger which changes the way cancellation of accounting entries works in KanivinERP. <a href="/kanvinerp/v13/user/manual/en/accounts/articles/immutable-ledger-in-kanvinerp">Learn more here</a>.</p>
