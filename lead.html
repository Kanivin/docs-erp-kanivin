<h1 class="wiki-title">Lead</h1>
</div>
<div class="wiki-content">
<p><strong>A lead is a potential customer who might be interested in your products or services.</strong></p>
<p>To get the customer through the door, you may be doing all or any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Listing your product on directories.</li>
<li>Maintaining an updated and searchable website.</li>
<li>Meeting people at trade events.</li>
<li>Advertising your products or services.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you send out the word that you are around and have something valuable to offer, people will come in to check out your products. These are your Leads.</p>
<p>They are called Leads because they may lead you to a sale. Sales executives usually work on leads by calling them, building a relationship and sending information about products or services. It is important to track all this conversation to enable another person who may have to follow-up on that contact. The new person is then able to know the history of that particular Lead.</p>
<p>To access the Lead list, go to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Home &gt; CRM &gt; Sales Pipeline &gt; Lead</p>
