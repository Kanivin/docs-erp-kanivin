<p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Need to calculate tax on the previous tax amount and not on the item amount.<br/>
For example, we have 5 items and Service Charge is calculated on the Net Total of the 5 items. Additionally, we need to calculate 5% VAT on the Service Charge of the Items and not on the Net Total of the Invoice. In this case, you need to follow the following steps:<br/>
1) In Sales Invoice, under the <strong>Sales Taxes and Charges</strong> section you need to set the tax calculation. In row 1, select the Type as <strong>"On Net Total"</strong> and Account Head as needed. Enter the Rate if not set already.The amount for this particular account head is calculated under the Amount column.<br/>
2) Next, you need to calculate tax on the previous row's amount (which is the tax amount). To do this, select the Type as <strong>"On Previous Row Amount".</strong> Set the Account Head and Rate as needed. Expand the row and set the <strong>Reference Row #</strong> as shown below.<br/>
