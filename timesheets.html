<p><strong>A Timesheet is the record of the number of hours spent by an employee on completion of each task.</strong></p>
<p>The Timesheet can also be used to calculate the billable towards an employee, to calculate their salaries, or to track an employee's contribution towards a Project or a Task.</p>
<p>In KanivinERP, a Timesheet can have an account of a particular employee working on multiple Tasks or Projects in a tabular format.</p>
