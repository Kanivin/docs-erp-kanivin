<p>A Loan Security Shortfall contains the details about:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Loan</strong>: The Loan against which there is a Loan to security value shortfall.</li>
<li><strong>Shortfall Time</strong>: The time at which the shortfall record was created.</li>
<li><strong>Status</strong>: The status of the shortfall. Pending is the default status and it changes to Complete once a payment is made or additional security is pledged against the loan to satisfy the shortfall.</li>
<li><strong>Loan Amount</strong>: Loan amount is the pending loan amount which is used for shortfall calculation.</li>
<li><strong>Security Value</strong>: Security Value is the current pledged security value.</li>
<li><strong>Shortfall Amount</strong>: Shortfall amount is the difference between the loan amount and the security value which needs to be repaid to complete the shortfall.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional Loan Security can be pledged against a loan from the Loan Security Shortfall itself via the <strong>Add Loan Security</strong> button on the top right.</p>
