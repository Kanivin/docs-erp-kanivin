<p><strong>Opportunity is a qualified lead.</strong></p>
<p>When you get a hint that lead is looking for a product/service that you offer, you can convert that lead into an opportunity. You can also create an opportunity against an existing customer. Multiple Opportunities can be collected against a lead or a customer.</p>
<p>To access the Opportunity list, go to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Home &gt; CRM &gt; Sales Pipeline &gt; Opportunity</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Best Practice: Leads and Opportunities are often referred as your “Sales
  Pipeline” this is what you need to track if you want to be able to predict how
  much business you are going to get in the future. Its always a good idea to be
  able to track what is coming in order to adjust your resources.</p>

<h3 id="26-capture-the-reasons-and-competitors-for-lost-opportunities">2.6 Capture the Reasons and Competitors for Lost Opportunities</h3>
<p>When an opportunity is lost, you can capture the reasons, competitors and detail reason for losing. This will help you to analyse the trends over a long period of time and identify the insights needed for improvements at various areas in the organisation.</p>

<h3 id="27-minutes-to-first-response">2.7 Minutes to First Response</h3>
