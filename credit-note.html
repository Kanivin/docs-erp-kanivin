</h1>

<div class="wiki-content">
<p><strong>A Credit Note is a document sent by a seller to the Customer, notifying that a credit has been made to their account against the goods returned by the buyer.</strong></p>
<p>A Credit Note is issued for the value of goods returned by the Customer, it may be less than or equal to the total amount of the order.</p>
<h2 id="1-how-to-make-a-credit-note">1. How to make a Credit Note</h2>
<p>The user can make a Credit Note against the Sales Invoice or they can directly make Credit Note from the Sales Invoice without reference. Note that to create a Credit Note, the invoice must be paid using a <a href="/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/accounts/payment-entry">Payment Entry</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Go to the respective Sales Invoice and click on <strong>Create &gt; Return / Credit Note</strong>.

<li><p>The Customer and Item details will be fetched as set in the Sales Invoice.</p></li>
<li>If the Customer had paid partially or fully, make a Payment Entry against the original Sales Invoice.</li>
<li><p>Save and Submit.</p>
<p><img alt="Credit Note" class="screenshot" src="/files/credit-note.png"/></p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Item quantity and Payment amount will be negative since it's a return.</p>
<h3 id="11-how-does-credit-note-affect-ledger">1.1 How does Credit Note affect ledger</h3>
<p>Once a Payment Entry is created against the original Sales Invoice, the amount will be added to the Customer's account in negative so that the next time they make a purchase, this amount will be adjusted.</p>
<p>This is how the ledger is affected after a payment entry against a returned invoice:

<p>Refer the <a href="/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/accounts/sales-invoice">Sales Invoice</a> page for any other details.</p>
<h3 id="12-no-payment-was-made-against-sales-invoice">1.2 No payment was made against Sales Invoice</h3>
<p>In case <strong>no payment</strong> was made against the original invoice, you could just cancel the Sales Invoice. But, if only 5 out of 10 Items are being returned from an invoice, creating a Credit Note is useful for updating the ledger.</p>
