</div>
<div class="wiki-content">
<p>Restricting a field based on Roles can be easily configured using Perm Level, which is required by most organizations. To define a <strong>Perm Level</strong>, you can go to the respective form and Customize it.</p>
<p>Let's take a scenario where the organization doesn't want its Employee (Accounts User) to edit the Rate of the item while creating a <strong>Sales</strong> <strong>Invoice</strong>. To do that, we can simply make the <strong>Item Rate</strong> field a _read-only_.</p>
<p>1. To achieve this, go to <strong>Customize Form</strong>, select DocType as <strong>Sales Invoice</strong> <strong>Item</strong>, scroll to the <strong>Item Rate</strong> field and expand it.</p>

<p>2. Search for the <strong>Perm Level</strong>, enter the number (0, 1, 2, 3, etc), and _Save_ it.</p>

<p>3. Once saved, click on <strong>Add a New Rule</strong> in Role Permission Manager and select the Document Type and the Role, in our case, _Accounts_ _User_, set the Perm Level as 2 and grant the Employee Read access.</p>

<p>This is how the Role Permissions Manager will display the newly created Rule with Perm Level as 2:</p>

<p>4. Now, as you can see in the Sales Invoice the User can only read the Item Rate field which will be fetched automatically from the Price List.</p>
