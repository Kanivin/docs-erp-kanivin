<p><img alt="Sales Flowchart" class="screenshot" src="/files/customer-to selling-flowchart.jpeg"/> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Customers are separate from Contacts and Addresses. A Customer can have multiple Contacts and Addresses.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Advanced Tip: KanivinERP supports <a href="/kanvinerp/v13/user/manual/en/accounts/inter-company-journal-entry">Multi-company Accounting</a>. You can use the same customer records in multiple companies. Since an accounting ledger is company specific, you need to select the company and the corresponding ledger in ACCOUNTING section if you decide have separate accounting ledger for a customer.</p>
