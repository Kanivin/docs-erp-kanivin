<div class="wiki-content">
<p><strong>A Pick List is a document that indicates which items should be taken from your inventory to fulfill orders.</strong></p>
<p>This is particularly useful for shippers with a large amount of inventory, volume of orders, or customers ordering many Stock Keeping Unit(SKU). Pick list selects Warehouse where an Item is available on FIFO (First-In-First-Out) basis. Selection of Warehouse for a batched item is different. In case of batched items, Warehouse where the batch is nearer to its expiry will be selected.</p>
<p>To access Pick List, go to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Home &gt; Stock &gt; Stock Transactions &gt; Pick List</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="1-prerequisites">1. Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Before creating and using a Pick List, it is advised that you create the following first:</p>
<ul>
<li><a onclick="loadContent('item.html')">Stock Item</a></li>
<li><a onclick="loadContent('warehouse.html')">Warehouse</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-how-to-create-pick-list">2. How to create Pick List</h2>
<ol>

<li>Set the Company.</li>
<li><p>Select the Purpose of Pick List. These are the options under Purpose:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Delivery:</strong> This option will let you add Items from a Sales Order, to deliver. After submitting Pick List a new Delivery Note can be created based on the Warehouse from which items were picked.</li>
<li><strong>Material Transfer for Manufacture:</strong> This will let you select a Work Order from which raw materials will be pulled for picking. You will be presented with an option to select the number of finished goods for which you want to pick raw materials. After picking the stock you can create Stock Entry for the picked items i.e., raw materials.</li>
<li><strong>Material Transfer:</strong> This will let you select a Material Request for which you want to pick items. After picking the stock you can create a Stock Entry for the picked items.</li>

<li><strong>Get Item Locations:</strong> Once items to be picked is finalized you can click on the <strong>Get Item Locations</strong> button to get Warehouse selection for each item.

<h3 id="32-barcode-scanning">3.2 Barcode Scanning</h3>
<p>Pick list supports barcode scanning, introducing two check boxes. <strong>Scan Mode</strong>, and <strong>Prompt Qty</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Scan Mode</strong>: Scan Mode in KanivinERP's Pick List feature is designed to streamline and verify the item-picking process in a warehouse or store environment. When using Scan Mode, users can scan barcodes on items to confirm that they are picking the correct products according to the Picklist. This mode is particularly useful for ensuring accuracy and efficiency during the picking process.</p>
<p><strong>Prompt Qty</strong>: When enabled, instead of incrementing the scanned items qty by 1, a dialog will prompt the user to enter a qty to increment by.</p>
<h2 id="4-pick-manually">4. Pick Manually</h2>
<p>In the pick list, if a user manually selects batches, the system overrides the changes upon saving the pick list. To solve this issue added a checkbox 'Pick Manually' in the pick list. If this checkbox is enabled, the system will not override the user's changes in the pick list.</p>
