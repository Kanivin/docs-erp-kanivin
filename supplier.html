<p>Add the default account from which invoices against this supplier will be paid. Add additional rows for more companies, you can select only one account per company.</p>
<p>You can <strong>integrate</strong> a supplier with an account. For all Suppliers, "Creditor" account is set as the default payable Account. When Purchase Invoice is created, payable towards the supplier is booked against "Creditors" account.</p>
<p>If you want to customize payable account for the Supplier, you should first add a payable Account in the Chart of Account, and then select that Payable Account in the Supplier master.</p>
<p><img alt="Supplier Master" class="screenshot" src="/files/supplier-payable-account.png"/> </p>
<p>If you don't want to customize payable account, and proceed with default payable account "Creditor", then do not update any value in the Default Supplier Account's table.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip: Default Payable Account is set in the Company master. If you want to set another account as Account as default for payable instead of Creditors Account, go to Company master, and set that account as "Default Payable Account".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Depending on your <a href="https://kanvinerp.com/pricing">plan</a>, you can add multiple companies in your KanivinERP instance. One Supplier can be used across multiple companies. In this case, you should define Company-wise Payable Account for the Supplier in the "Default Payable Accounts" table, i.e, add multiple rows.</p>

<p>You can add the supplier's website and any additional details about your supplier in this section. If you freeze a supplier with the 'Is Frozen' option, accounting entries for the supplier will be frozen. In this case the only user whose entries will surpass the 'freeze' is the role assigned in 'Role Allowed to Set Frozen Accounts &amp; Edit Frozen Entries' in Accounting &gt; Settings &gt; Accounts Settings. This is useful when the supplier's name or bank details are being amended.</p>
