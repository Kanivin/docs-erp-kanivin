<p><strong>A Payment Term helps to set a schedule according to which payments will be made.</strong></p>
<p>A Payment Term defines a specific payment slab. For example, 50% payment on shipping and 50% on delivery of the item. You can save your business's payment terms on KanivinERP and include them in all documents in the sales/purchase cycle. KanivinERP will make all the General Ledger entries accordingly.</p>
<p>In KanivinERP, the Payment Terms form only defines portion percentages. The actual payment schedule can easily be applied using the Payment Terms Template.</p>
<p>You can use Payment Terms in the following documents:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sales Invoice</li>
<li>Purchase Invoice</li>
<li>Sales Order</li>
<li>Purchase Order</li>
<li>Quotation</li>
</ul>
<p>To access Payment Term go to:</p>
