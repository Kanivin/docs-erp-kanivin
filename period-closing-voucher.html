</h1>
</div>
<div class="wiki-content">
<p><strong>A Period Closing Voucher indicates that the profit/loss for an accounting period has been balanced and the books can start fresh.</strong></p>
<p>At the end of every year or (quarterly or maybe even monthly), after completing auditing, you can close your books of accounts. This means that you make all your special entries like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Depreciation</li>
<li>Change in value of Assets</li>
<li>Defer taxes and liabilities</li>
<li>Update bad debts</li>
</ul>
<p>Then book your Profit or Loss.</p>
<p>By doing this, your balance in your Income and Expense Accounts becomes zero. You start a new Fiscal Year (or period) with a balanced Balance Sheet and fresh Profit and Loss account. In KanivinERP after making all the special entries via Journal Entry for the current fiscal year, you should set all your Income and Expense accounts to zero via a Period Closing Voucher.</p>
<p>To access the Period Closing Voucher list, go to:</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If accounting entries are made in a closing Fiscal Year, even after Period Closing Voucher was created for that Fiscal Year, you should create another Period Closing Voucher. Later voucher will only transfer the pending P&amp;L balance into Closing Account Head.</p>
