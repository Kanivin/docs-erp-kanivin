<blockquote>
<p>Introduced in Version 12</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dimensional accounting means tagging each transaction with appropriate dimensions like Branch, Business Unit, etc. This allows you to maintain each segment separately, thereby limiting the overall maintenance on GL accounts and your Chart of Accounts remains pure.</p>
<p>Cost Center and Project are treated as dimensions by default in KanivinERP. On setting a field in Accounting Dimension, that field will be added in transactions reports where applicable.</p>
<p>In KanivinERP you can create configurable accounting dimensions and use them in transactions and reports.</p>
<p>To access the Accounting Dimension list, go to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Home &gt; Accounting &gt; Settings &gt; Accounting Dimensions</p>
