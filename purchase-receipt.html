<p><strong>Purchase Receipts are made when you accept Items from your Supplier usually against a Purchase Order.</strong></p>
<p>You can also accept Purchase Receipts directly without the need for a Purchase Order. To do this, set Purchase Order
Required as “No” in Buying Settings.</p>
<p>To access the Purchase Receipt list, go to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Home &gt; Stock &gt; Stock Transactions &gt; Purchase Receipt</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Purchase Receipt flow" class="screenshot" src="/files/purchase-receipt-flow.png"/></p>
<h2 id="1-prerequisites">1. Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Before creating and using a Purchase Receipt, it is advised that you create the following first:</p>
<ul>
<li><a onclick="loadContent('purchase-order.html')">Purchase Order</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Note: From version-13 onwards we have introduced immutable ledger which changes the rules for cancellation of stock entries and posting backdated stock transactions in KanivinERP. <a href="/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/accounts/articles/immutable-ledger-in-erpnext">Learn more here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="2-how-to-create-a-purchase-receipt">2. How to create a Purchase Receipt</h2>
<p>A Purchase Receipt is usually created from a <a href="/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/buying/purchase-order">Purchase Order</a>. In the Purchase Order, click on Create &gt; Purchase Receipt.</p>
<p>To create a Purchase Receipt _manually_ (not recommended), follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the Purchase Receipt list, click on New.</li>
<li>The Supplier name and the Items can be fetched from the Purchase Order by clicking on 'Get Items from &gt; Purchase Order'.</li>
<li>You can set the Accepted Warehouse for all items in this Purchase Receipt. This is fetched if set in Purchase Order.</li>
<li>In case any Items are defective, set the Rejected Warehouse where those Items will be stored.</li>
<li>Select the Item and enter the quantity in the Items table.</li>
<li>The rate will be fetched and the amount will be calculated automatically.</li>
<li>You can expand the item row to change the Accepted Warehouse for an Item.</li>
<li><p>Save and submit.</p>
<p><img alt="Purchase Receipt" class="screenshot" src="/files/purchase-receipt.png"/></p></li>
</ol>
<p>You can also add a 'Supplier Delivery Note' to the Purchase Receipt if your Supplier has added some notes.
Using the 'Edit Posting Date and Time' checkbox you can edit the posting time and date of the Purchase Receipt. By default, the date and time are set when you click on the New button.</p>
<p>Is Return: Tick this checkbox if you're returning Items that were not accepted to your Warehouse.</p>
<h3 id="21-statuses">2.1 Statuses</h3>
<p>These are the statuses a Purchase Receipt can be in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Draft</strong>: A draft is saved but yet to be submitted to the system.</li>
<li><strong>To Bill</strong>: Yet to be billed using a <a onclick="loadContent('purchase-invoice.html')">Purchase Invoice</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Completed</strong>: Submitted and received all the Items.</li>
<li><strong>Return Issued</strong>: All the Items have been returned.</li>
<li><strong>Cancelled</strong>: Cancelled the Purchase Receipt.</li>
<li><strong>Closed</strong>: The purpose of the Close is to manage short-closing. For example, you ordered 20 qty, but closing at 15 qty. The remaining 5 is not to be received or billed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-features">3. Features</h2>
<h3 id="31-currency-and-price-list">3.1 Currency and Price List</h3>
<p>The currency of the Purchase Receipt is shown in this section, it is fetched from the Purchase Order. The item prices will be fetched from the set Price list. Ticking on Ignore Pricing Rule will ignore the Pricing Rules set in Accounts &gt; Pricing Rule.</p>
<p>Since the incoming Item affects the value of your inventory, it is important to convert it into your base currency if you have ordered in another Currency. You will need to update the Currency Conversion Rate if applicable.</p>
<p>Read about <a href="/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/stock/price-lists">Price Lists</a>
and <a href="/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/accounts/articles/managing-transactions-in-multiple-currency">Multi-Currency Transactions</a>
to know more.</p>
<h3 id="32-warehouse-details">3.2 Warehouse details</h3>
<p>The following Warehouses set will apply to all Items in the Items table of the Purchase Receipt. You can change the Warehouses for individual Items via the table.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accepted Warehouse</strong>: This is the Warehouse in which you'll accept and store the incoming Items. Usually, this is the 'Stores' Warehouse.</li>
<li><strong>Rejected Warehouse:</strong> This is the Warehouse in which you'll keep the rejected Items which were either defective or not up to the quality mark.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="subcontracting">Subcontracting</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Raw Materials Consumed</strong>: In case you're subcontracting, select 'Yes' to consume the Raw Materials from the vendor. Read <a onclick="loadContent('subcontracting.html')">Subcontracting</a> to know more.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="33-items-table">3.3 Items table</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Barcode</strong>: You can track Items using <a href="/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/stock/articles/track-items-using-barcode">barcodes</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scan Barcode</strong>: You can add Items in the Items table by scanning their barcodes if you have a barcode scanner. Read documentation for <a href="/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/stock/articles/track-items-using-barcode">tracking items using barcode</a> to know more.</p></li>
<li><p>The Item Code, name, description, Image, and Manufacturer will be fetched from the Item master.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Received and Accepted</strong>: Set the received, accepted and rejected quantity. The UoM is fetched from the Item master. You will need to update the “UOM Conversion Factor” if your Purchase Order for an Item is in a different Unit of Measure (UOM) than what you stock (Stock UOM).</p>
<p><img alt="Purchase Receipt Items table" class="screenshot" src="/files/purchase-receipt-item.png"/></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rate</strong>: The Rate is fetched if set in the <a href="/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/stock/price-lists">Price List</a> and the total Amount is calculated.</p></li>

<li><p>The Item Weight details per unit and Weight UOM are fetched if set in the Item master.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Warehouse and Reference</strong>: You can set the accepted and rejected Warehouses and also add a Quality Inspection, see next section.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Serial No, Batch No, and BOM</strong>: If your Item is serialized or batched, you will have to enter Serial Number
and Batch in the Items table. You are allowed to enter multiple Serial Numbers
in one row (each on a separate line) and you must enter the same number of
Serial Numbers as the quantity.</p>
<p>There are separate fields for entering Serial Numbers of both accepted and rejected Items here. A Batch Number can also be set if you're storing a batch of plastic medicines for example.</p>
<p>Ticking on 'Allow Zero Valuation Rate' will allow submitting the Purchase Receipt even if the Valuation Rate of the Item is 0. This can be a sample item or due to a mutual understanding with your Supplier.</p></li>
<li><p>You can link a BOM here if the Item is being <a href="/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/manufacturing/subcontracting">subcontracted</a>. Linking the BOM here will affect the Stock ledger, i.e. the raw material stock will be deducted from the Supplier Warehouse.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The Item has to be serialized or batched for these features to work. If the Item is serialized a popup will appear where you can enter the Serial Numbers.</p></li>
<li><p>Accounting Dimensions help to tag each transaction with different Dimensions without the need for creating new Cost Centers. You need to create Accounting Dimensions first, to know more, visit <a href="/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/accounts/accounting-dimensions">this page</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Page Break will create a page break just before this item when printing.</p></li>

<h4 id="changing-the-value-of-items-post-purchase-receipt">Changing the value of Items post Purchase Receipt:</h4>
<p>Sometimes, certain expenses that add to the total of your purchased Items are known
only after a while. Common example is, if you are importing the Items, you
will come to know of Customs Duty, etc only when your “Clearing Agent” sends
you a bill. If you want to attribute this cost to your purchased Items, you
will have to use the <a href="/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/stock/landed-cost-voucher">Landed Cost Voucher</a>. Why “Landed Cost”? Because it represents the charges that you paid when it landed in your possession.</p>
