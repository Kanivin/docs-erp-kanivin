<p><strong>Actual:</strong> This allows you to enter expense amount directly. For example, Rs. 500 incurred for Shipping.</p>
<p><strong>On Net Total:</strong> If you want to apply any tax or charges on Net Total, select this option. For example, 18% GST applied to all the item in the Sales Order.</p>
<p><strong>On Previous Row Amount:</strong> This option helps you want to calculate tax amount calculated based on another tax amount.</p>
<p>Example: Education Cess is calculated based on the amount of GST tax.</p>
<p><strong>On Previous Row Total:</strong> For each Tax row, a cumulative tax is calculated in the Total column. For the first row, total tax is calculated as Net Total + Tax amount at first row. If you want to apply a tax on the Total Amount of another tax row, then use this option.</p>
<p>If you select Type as Previous Row Amount or Previous Row Total, then you must also specify a Row No. whose Amount or Total should be considered for the calculation.</p>
<p><strong>On Item Quantity:</strong> This option can be used for fixed/item specific taxes.</p>
