</div>
<div class="wiki-content">
<p><strong>Payment Reconciliation is used to link payments with invoices.</strong></p>
<p>In complex scenarios, especially in the capital goods industry, sometimes there is no direct link between payments and invoices. For example, suppose a party is a customer, you send invoices to a customer and the customer sends you block payments or payments based on some schedule that is not linked to your invoices.</p>
<p>In such cases, you can match Payments with Invoices using Payment Reconciliation.</p>
<p>To access Payment Reconciliation, go to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Home &gt; Accounting &gt; Accounts Receivable &gt; Payment Reconciliation</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="1-how-to-match-payments-with-invoices">1. How to Match Payments with Invoices</h2>
<ol>
<li>Go to Payment Reconciliation.</li>
<li>Select a Company.</li>
<li>Select a Party Type and select the Party. The Receivable/Payable account will be selected automatically.</li>
<li>Select the Bank/Cash account against which the payments need to be reconciled.</li>
<li>If you want to filter the records, select a date range for the invoices or set minimum or maximum amount for invoices as well as payment transactions</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Get Unreconciled Entries</strong> button.</li>
<li>This will fetch all un-linked invoices and payment transactions from that party in Invoices and Payments table resp.</li>
<li>You can either select any particular entries to be allocated or can click on <strong>Allocate</strong> button without selecting anything to allocate all the entries.</li>
<li>Allocation table will be populated based on FIFO or/and selection.</li>
<li>Allocated Amount is the amount you want to allocate for the reconciliation.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Reconcile</strong> to reconcile allocated entries. You will get a message that says 'Successfully Reconciled'.</li>

<h2 id="2-what-happens-on-payment-reconciliation">2. What happens on Payment Reconciliation</h2>
<p>If the invoices are reconciled against: </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Payment Entry</strong> - A journal entry is not auto-created when reconciliation happens against a payment entry. This is because payment entries are associated with linked transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Credit/Debit Note</strong> - A journal entry is auto-created to allocate a credit/debit note to an invoice that is being reconciled. This automatic creation of a journal entry is necessary since credit/debit notes do not have linked transactions. The journal entry resulting from the reconciliation indicates the adjustment of a particular credit/debit note with a specific invoice.</li>
