<p><strong>A Debit Note is a document sent by a buyer to the Supplier notifying that a debit has been recorded against the goods returned to the Supplier.</strong></p>
<p>A Debit Note is issued for the value of the goods returned. In some cases, sellers are seen sending Debit Notes which should be treated as like another invoice.</p>
<p>A Debit is for your record of the debit against the Items your return.</p>
<h2 id="1-how-to-create-debit-note">1. How to create Debit Note</h2>
<p>The user can make a Debit Note against the Purchase Invoice or they can directly make Debit Note from the Purchase Invoice without reference.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the respective Purchase Invoice and click on <strong>Create &gt; Return / Debit Note</strong>.

<li>The Supplier and Item details will be fetched as set in the Purchase Invoice.</li>
<li>If you had paid partially or fully, make a Payment Entry against the original Purchase Invoice.</li>
<li><p>Save and Submit.</p>
<p><img alt="Debit Note" class="screenshot" src="/files/debit-note.png"/></p></li>
</ol>
<p>The other steps are similar to a <a href="/kanvinerp/v13/user/manual/en/accounts/purchase-invoice">Purchase Invoice</a>.</p>
<h3 id="11-how-does-debit-note-affect-ledger">1.1 How does Debit Note affect ledger</h3>

<p>Refer the <a href="/kanvinerp/v13/user/manual/en/accounts/purchase-invoice">Purchase Invoice</a> page for any other details.</p>
<h3 id="12-no-payment-was-made-against-sales-invoice">1.2 No payment was made against Sales Invoice</h3>
<p>In case <strong>no payment</strong> was made against the original invoice, you could just cancel the Sales Invoice. But, if only 5 out of 10 Items are being returned from an invoice, creating a Debit Note is useful for updating the ledger.</p>
