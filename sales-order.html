<p><strong>A Sales Order is a confirmation of an order from your customer.</strong></p>
<p>It is usually a binding Contract with your Customer. Once your customer confirms the Quotation you can convert your Quotation into a Sales Order.</p>
<p><img alt="Sales Flow" class="screenshot" src="/files/selling-flow-so.png"/></p>
<p>To access Sales Order, go to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Home &gt; Selling &gt; Sales &gt; Sales Order</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="1-prerequisites">1. Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Before creating and using a Sales Order, it is advised that you create the following first:</p>
<ul>
<li><a onclick="loadContent('customer.html')">Customer</a></li>
<li><a onclick="loadContent('item.html')">Item</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-how-to-create-a-sales-order">2. How to create a Sales Order</h2>
<ol>
<li>Go to the Sales Order list, click on New.</li>
<li>Select the Customer.</li>
<li>Set the 'Delivery Date' - applied to the whole order.</li>
<li>With Order Type, you can set whether it's a Sales order, Maintenance order, or from the online <a onclick="loadContent('shopping-cart.html')">Shopping Cart</a> of your website. By default, this value is set to "Sales".</li>
<li>In the "Customer's Purchase Order" you can enter the Customers Purchase Order No. or other details which may be useful as a reference.</li>
<li>Enter the items and quantities to be delivered in the Item table. If Item Prices are set for the items, the Rate field will be populated automatically. If not, enter the item Rate manually. You can also overwrite the auto-populated Item Rate in case you want to change that value.</li>
<li>Click "Save" to save a draft of the Sales Order.</li>
<li>"Submit" to submit the Sales Order to the System.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="21-other-ways-to-create-a-sales-order">2.1 Other ways to create a Sales Order</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>You can also create a Sales Order from a submitted Quotation via the Create button on the top right.</p>
<p><img alt="Make Sales Order from Quotation" class="screenshot" src="/files/make-SO-from-quote.png"/></p></li>
<li><p>Or you can create a new Sales Order and pull details from a Quotation.</p>
<p><img alt="Make Sales Order from Quotation" class="screenshot" src="/files/so-from-quote.gif"/></p></li>
</ol>
<p>To allow for per-Customer, per-Item Pricing Rules, ("Customer A" pays $1.00 for "Item 1" but "Customer B" pays $1.25 for "Item 1"), there's a check box called 'Allow User to Edit Price List Rate in Transaction' in <a href="/kanvinerp/v13/user/manual/en/selling/selling-settings">Selling Settings</a>. This enables saving the specific item price per customer when you change a price in the Sales Order.</p>
<h2 id="3-features">3. Features</h2>
<h3 id="31-currency-and-price-list">3.1 Currency and Price List</h3>
<p>You can set the currency in which the quotation/sales order is to be sent. If you set a Pricing List, then the item prices will be fetched from that list. Ticking on 'Ignore Pricing Rule' will ignore the <a href="/kanvinerp/v13/user/manual/en/accounts/pricing-rule">Pricing Rules</a> set in Accounts &gt; Pricing Rule.</p>
<p>Read about <a href="/kanvinerp/v13/user/manual/en/stock/price-lists">Price Lists</a>
and <a href="/kanvinerp/v13/user/manual/en/accounts/articles/managing-transactions-in-multiple-currency">Multi-Currency Transactions</a>
to know more.</p>
<h3 id="31-set-source-warehouse">3.1 Set Source Warehouse</h3>
<p>If you have the same stock in multiple warehouses, setting a warehouse here will cause all the items from the item table to be fetched from this warehouse. You need to have stock available in this 'source warehouse' you're setting. Note that this option will override the 'Default Warehouse' you've set in the Item master.</p>
<h3 id="32-the-items-table">3.2 The Items Table</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Delivery Date against each item</strong>: If there are multiple items and if you enter a delivery date in the first row, the date will be copied to other rows as well where it is blank. You'll have to set these if not set globally at the top of the Sales Order.</p>
<p>A Sales Order displays the billed amount, valuation rate, and gross profit in the items table when you click on the inverted triangle to expand a row.</p>
<p>You can also add Items in the Items table by scanning their barcodes if you have a barcode scanner. Read documentation for <a href="/kanvinerp/v13/user/manual/en/stock/articles/track-items-using-barcode">tracking items using barcode</a> to know more.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Delivery Warehouse</strong>: This is the warehouse from where the stock will be picked to be delivered to your customer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Drop Ship</strong>: This is a situation where you do not keep items in stock in your own Warehouse but deliver items directly to a customer from a distributor. To enable drop shipping for an item tick on the 'Supplier delivers to Customer'. When you tick on this, the Delivery Warehouse option will disappear since you're not shipping the item. Select your supplier in the 'Supplier' field.</p>
<p>Further, if you create a purchase order from this sales order, it'll be created for the supplier you selected here and only the items which are valid for drop shipping.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Planning</strong>: Read <a href="/kanvinerp/v13/user/manual/en/stock/projected-quantity">Projected Quantity</a> to know about the fields under planning.</p></li>
</ul>
