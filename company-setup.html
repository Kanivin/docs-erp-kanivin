</div>
<div class="wiki-content">
<p><strong>A company is a legal entity made up of an association of people for carrying on a commercial or industrial enterprise.</strong></p>
<p>In KanivinERP, the first Company is created when an KanivinERP account is set up. For each Company, you can set a domain as manufacturing, retail, or services depending on the nature of your business activity.</p>
<p>If you have more than one company, you can add them from:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Home &gt; Accounting &gt; Company</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="1-how-to-create-a-new-company">1. How to create a new Company</h2>
<ol>
<li>Go to the Company list, click on New.</li>
<li>Enter the name, abbreviation, and default currency for the company.</li>
<li>Save.</li>
</ol>
<p>The abbreviation for your company is created by default. For example, FT for Frappe Technologies. The abbreviation helps in differentiating assets of one company from another.</p>
<p>The abbreviation also appears in various accounts, cost centers, taxes templates, warehouse, etc, of your company.</p>
<p>You can also attach a company logo and add a description for the company.</p>
<p><img alt="Company Master" class="screenshot" src="/files/company-master.png"/> </p>
<h3 id="11-multi-company-structure">1.1 Multi Company Structure</h3>
<p>Let's assume you run a group of companies, some may be larger companies and some may be smaller that are a part of the larger company(s).</p>
<p>In KanivinERP, you can set up multiple companies. The company structure can be parallel, i.e., sister companies, parent-child companies, or a combination of both.</p>
<p>A parent company is a larger organization which consists of one or more child companies. A child company is a subsidiary of a parent company.</p>
<p>The company tree view displays the overall structure of your companies.</p>
<p><img alt="Company Tree" class="screenshot" src="/files/company-tree.png"/> </p>
<p>Once you build a company tree, KanivinERP will validate if the accounts of the child companies match the accounts in the parent company. All the accounts can be combined in a consolidated chart of accounts statement.</p>
<h3 id="12-other-options-when-creating-a-company">1.2 Other Options when Creating a Company</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain</strong>: The domain of work the company is into. Eg: manufacturing, services, etc. Choose one when setting up your account.</li>
<li><strong>Is Group</strong>: If checked, this becomes a parent company.</li>
<li><strong>Parent Company</strong>: If this is a child company, set the parent from this field i.e., select a group company this company belongs to. If a parent company is set, the chart of accounts for the new company you're creating will be created based on the selected parent company.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="13-chart-of-accounts">1.3 Chart of Accounts</h3>
<p>For each Company, the master for Chart of Accounts is maintained separately. This allows you to maintain separate accounting for each company as per the legal requirements. You can also import chart of accounts using the <a href="/kanvinerp/v13/user/manual/en/setting-up/chart-of-accounts-importer">Charts Of Accounts Importer</a>.</p>
<p>KanivinERP has localized Chart of Accounts readily available for some countries. When creating a new Company, you can choose to set up the Chart of Account for it from one of the following options.</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard Chart of Accounts</li>
<li>Based on Existing Company's Chart of Account</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Company Chart of Accounts" class="screenshot" src="/files/new-company-coa-based-on.png"/> </p>
<p>Note that, if the Parent Company is selected when creating a new Company, the Chart of Accounts will be created based on the existing Parent Company.</p>
<h3 id="14-defaults">1.4 Defaults</h3>
<p>Within the Company master, you can set many of the default values for masters and accounts. These default accounts will help you in the quick posting of accounting transactions, where the value for the account will be fetched from the Company master if provided. As soon as the company is created, a default Chart Of Accounts and Cost Center is automatically created.</p>
<p>The following defaults can be set for a company:</p>
<ul>
<li>Default Letter Head</li>
<li>Default Holiday List</li>
<li>Standard Working Hours</li>
<li>Default Terms and Conditions</li>
